--- 1. Overview --------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains 3D models and drawings of common tools needed for 
packing round canopy static line parachutes. Specifically these tools are 
used to pack the following parachutes: MC1-1D, T-10D, MC-6, SET-10.

This file is organized into sections. The section number is preceeded by a 
space and 3 hyphens. The section number is terminated by a single period. The 
section name follows the section number and section number terminating period.

These models are created by measuring products available commercially. Since 
they are simple sheet metal parts I wanted dimensions and drawings of them. 

If you don't trust these models/drawings, or you have doubts then you should 
purchase the commercially available products after which they are modeled. 

If you elect to manufacture these tools yourself remember to follow safety 
precautions, rules, regulations, etc. Remember to BREAK ALL EDGES and sharp 
corners! Even if an edge/corner isn't supposed to be in contact with the 
parachute you should make it as if it were. You never know how tools will 
bounce around in a toolbox.

--- 2. 3D Models: .3mf -------------------------------------------------------
Files with the extension .3mf are viewable in the "3D Viewer" application 
included with Windows 10 and Windows 11. You can also view this program in 
most 3D mesh viewing applications which support .stl files. The following .3mf 
models are included:

Line Separator.3mf: The line separator.
Packing Hook.3mf: The packing hook.
Riser Tension Plate.3mf: The riser tension plate. The riser tension plate has 
                         a slight modification with how the webbing attaches. 
						 Instead of a triangular cutout in the commercial 
						 product which accepts 1 23/32inch webbing, I 
						 modified the design to use 1inch webbing into a 
						 simple slot. This slot can be made by chain-drilling 
						 holes and filling the edges smooth.
Riser Tension Plate_Weighted.3mf: A modified version of the riser tension 
                                  plate. This version has holes drilled and 
								  counter-sunk for No. 4 solid aluminum 
								  countersunk rivets.


--- 3. 3D Models: .STEP ------------------------------------------------------
Files with the extension .STEP (or .stp) are 3D models written in the ISO 
10303-21 format. The file names and descriptions are the same as those in 
Section 2. All files are exported to STEP A214 standard from SolidWorks 2023.


--- 4. 3D Models: .SLDPRT and .SLDASM ----------------------------------------
Files with the extension .SLDPRT are SolidWorks models. The extension .SLDASM 
denotes SolidWorks assembly files. Files were created in SolidWorks 2023. The 
file names and descriptions are the same as those in Section 2.
